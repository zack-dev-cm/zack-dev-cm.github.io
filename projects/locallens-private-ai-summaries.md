# OpenClaw CWS Publisher + LocalLens

> Privacy-first Chrome extension and OpenClaw publishing agent for local AI summaries.

## Summary
This project pairs a user-facing Chrome extension with an operator-facing release agent. `LocalLens` summarizes, simplifies, translates, and safe-shares page text locally with Chrome built-in AI. `OpenClaw CWS Publisher` inventories local extension repos, generates store assets, scans for leak risks, builds the extension ZIP, and drives Chrome Web Store submission through OpenClaw browser automation.
