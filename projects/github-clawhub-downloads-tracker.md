# GitHub + ClawHub Downloads Tracker

> CLI and report flow for tracking GitHub stars, dated ClawHub snapshots, publisher stats, and traction deltas.

## Summary
GitHub + ClawHub Downloads Tracker packages the `github-stars-optimizer` workflow into a public evidence surface. It pulls GitHub repository metadata, ClawHub leaderboards, explicit skill slugs, and Chrome Web Store detail-page stats, then renders a blunt traction report with downloads, star conversion gaps, snapshot deltas, 30-day scenarios, and consolidation bets. It keeps ClawHub snapshots visible in the portfolio instead of burying them inside separate package pages.
